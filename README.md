## Overview
This project investigates how the acoustic properties of initially selected songs affect subsequent recommendations generated by Spotify’s algorithm.  
It examines whether recommended tracks preserve or diverge from features such as **energy**, **valence**, **danceability**, and **acousticness**, across multiple genres.  

---

## Experimental Design
- **Factors considered:** Gender (2 levels), Age (3 levels), Source Genre (5 aggregated genres).  
- **Total conditions:** $2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30$.  
- **Accounts created:** 90 accounts (3 per condition).  
Each playlist was generated using two seed songs—one recent/popular and one older/less popular—to balance effects of popularity and release period.  

---

## Data Collection
- Data gathered using Spotify Web API via the Spotipy library with OAuth authentication.  
- Audio features extracted through ReccoBeats API.  
- Each playlist contained 50 tracks: 2 seeds + 48 recommendations.  
- Dataset included both continuous features (e.g., energy, loudness) and categorical ones (key, mode).  

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Duplicate playlists removed to ensure unique recommendation histories.  
- Missing values imputed using genre-wise medians for continuous variables and most frequent categories for categorical ones.  
- Final dataset: **79 users**, **4,057 observations**, across **21 variables**.

## Methods Used
1. **UpSet Visualization** – To analyze cross‑genre overlaps beyond Venn diagram limitations.  
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – To reduce multicollinearity among correlated audio features such as energy and loudness.  
3. **Metric Space Formulation & Drift Metric** – Combining Euclidean distance (continuous features) and Hamming distance (categorical features) to quantify deviation from seed songs.  
4. **Linear Regression & t‑Tests** – To model drift trends across playlist positions and test significance of coefficients.

## Key Findings

### Genre Overlap
Average purity ratio = **78.98%**, meaning ~21% of recommended songs appeared in playlists from multiple genres (“genre contamination”). Roots/Jazz/Classical traditions showed complete exclusivity; Pop, Urban, Rock exhibited higher overlap.

### PCA Results
Six principal components retained ~90% variance — effectively reducing redundancy among correlated acoustic attributes.

### Global Drift Patterns
Rock & Heavy had lowest mean drift → stable recommendations close to seeds; Urban & Contemporary showed highest variability → diverse exploration patterns.

### Position‑Wise Drift Trends
Significant negative slopes for:
- Electronic & Beat-Based ($β₁ = −0.0059$)
- Roots/Jazz/Classical ($β₁ = −0.0068$)  

Both indicate convergence toward seed characteristics over time; other genres remained stable without directional drift change.

## Tools & Libraries

Implemented in Python 3.12 using:
- `pandas`, `numpy` — data handling,
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `upsetplot` — visualization,
- `scikit-learn`, `scipy.stats` — analysis,
- Assisted text refinement with Perplexity AI LLM toolset.

## Conclusion

Spotify’s recommendation algorithm exhibits genre-dependent behavior:
- Reinforces genre identity in acoustically distinct styles (**electronic/classical**)  
- Promotes stylistic blending within contemporary categories (**pop/urban**)  

The project highlights how starting song selection can influence personalization dynamics while balancing consistency with exploratory diversity in music discovery.
